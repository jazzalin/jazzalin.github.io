Welcome to my personal website! Some of the projects showcased on these pages were started as a robotics student at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) and the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca), and others as a researcher at the [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int) and the [ZHAW](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/university/).

I am currently a Research Associate at the School of Engineering at [HES-SO Valais-Wallis](https://www.hevs.ch/en).
